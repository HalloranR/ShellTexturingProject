# ShellTexturingProject
This repository is my submission of Acerola's shell texturing challenge

My goal for this project was to implement shell texturing with rotation and alternating colors. I had a lot of fun creating this project and some headaches as I was figuring out how to get the tiling for squares instead of circles. All in all I now feel way more confident with shaders and have a solid grasp on the rendering pipeline. Now I just need to learn about compute shaders :)
